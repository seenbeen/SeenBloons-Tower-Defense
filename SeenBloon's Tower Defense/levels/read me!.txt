Note:
the following levels in here are all test levels. ie: they're pretty much
all the same and very easy to beat.


the last level is the one that prevents the game from crashing;
in other words, it sends half a bajillion rainbow bloons down the road
to almost guarantee kill the player.

more levels may be added in the future, and score is calculated on the level you make
it to.
