# SeenBloon's Tower Defense
![](/ScreenShots/screenshot1.png?raw=true "Yes, balancing wasn't exactly on my list :P")
## Remarks
- Another Tower Defense game, with sprites shamelessly ripped from Bloon's Tower Defense (creds to them for graphix).
- Everything else is written from scratch using Java and Java AWT
- There is a tools folder which contains a tool to generate a Bloon map path, as well as one to generate spawn patterns (these are written using Python 2.7 and the corresponding Pygame library)
- I didn't bother making many levels and try to "kill" the player at Level 6+; however there /is/ a way to beat it, so I guess that's a challenge ;)

## Features
- 5 Types of Bloonz, with varying speeds and layers
- 6 Unique Towers
- 3 Upgrades per tower :0
- Unique projectiles (from darts to plasma ballz to rocketz)
- Bloon statuses (like freeze and glue!)
- Explosions!
- Lots of monkeys
- Absolutely NO BALANCE :3
- Highscores
- Awesome user interface (with "helpful" comments on hover!)
- Range indicators and placement indicators for towers
- Custom map and level support!
- ... and more [cuz im lazy]

## Building and Running
Requirements: Min. JDK 7 installed
1) Run `build.sh` - This will generate a build folder with the compiled `.class` files.
2) Run `run.sh` - This assumes that the project has been succesfully built and will run the game.
3) Getting Started: Click and drag an affordable Tower from the right onto the map; Press GO!
